# DimsumPanda's Website #

This is my personal website. I often go by DimsumPanda for my artworks and my coding. I haven't figured out how I would like to separate myself from my works... so I am using my real name. It's my portfolio after all.

I'm currently working on a website redesign. I would like to showcase my projects more as well as integrating bootstrap in my website.
The content also needs to be updated, especially.
